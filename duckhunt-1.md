# Duck creation!

 1. Create a "createDuck" function that creates a duck with these steps:
  - create a div with a class of "duck" 
  - append it to the body
  - use setInterval to toggle the class "flap" on the duck every 250ms


2. Use a for loop to call createDuck 5 times (they will overlap so open your console to see if they are all there!)
