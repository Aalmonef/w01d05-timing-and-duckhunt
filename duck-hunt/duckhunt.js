  // Duck creation!

  // Create a "createDuck" function that creates a duck with these steps:
  // - create a div with a class of "duck" 
  // - append it to the body
  // - use setInterval to toggle the class "flap" on the duck every 250ms


  // Use a for loop to call createDuck 5 times (they will overlap so open
  // your console to see if they are all there!)
